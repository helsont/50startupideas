Failed startups - were these too early?

Idea List:
- New Shell:
Shell is still in the dark ages. I have the hardest time string tiny UNIX programs to get a job done.
Python, Node, Ruby are all easy to use, advance scripting languages.
Create shell script 2.0.
Is there a scripting language designed for file I/O, piping data between smaller subroutines, outputting results, and pretty printing log information back to the user? I have to dig through tons of disparate help docs to get the job done today. Command line apis are crazy.

- Interactive programming IDE
I create a file, declare a class, and write a function. But I believe in TDD, so I need to write a unit test before I even write my function. So I create a new file, declare my `testMyFunction` function, and start writing asserts.

This seems stupid.

I should be able to, in my IDE, right where I declared the original class/function/file, markup my function with asserts. And I should be able to execute and declare my test cases, all in this *one* view. Basically, my file should have all the testing *metadata* right there in the same visual place!

When I want to consider interactions between classes, I should also be able to create tests about how these classes interact with each other. And also define how classes don't or shouldn't interact with each other. My compiler's wheels should also be spinning and warning me of bad OOP, god classes, functions that should be split, and any cyclical/odd dependencies between classes.

- Customer discovery product
Note taking software for customer discovery. Associate your notes with a user ids / database.. Integrate your learning all together in one place. Survey customers and make sure you're asking people consistent questions.

See trends and relationships between customer types. Define your surveys so you can do customer interviews in the same regimented way.

Summarize what you've learned daily and week over week. Summarize by creating customer profiles.

- DNS management tool to avoid downtime
Maybe I'm just dumb, but I have a feeling configuring DNS is hard for a lot of people. There's no way for me to test changes before deploying! It's an all or nothing thing. It's scary. And if you get it wrong, you're down. Great, now people are pissed.

- Travel(?)
One variation: App tailored to the study abroad student experience.
Another: So much of Instagram's content is around travel. Hell, just today I saw a report that Europeans were MAD that so many tourists were traveling due to personal brand building via travel pictures. Are there problems here we can help solve?

- Truth and Identity

Quote: regarding a letter, “The letter prompted a raft of comment after it was published in the Romanian news media this week. Its authenticity has not been challenged.”

Blockchain independent verification of messaging protocol.
Why should we ever doubt of the veracity and truth behind who sent a message? Stamp it and verify it so government officials (or anyone who wants to own and verify their messaging) can stamp messages and declare them as true.

- Small idea (feature): Appointment setting in email
When you send an email to schedule with someone, you should be able to auto generate something like this:
Tues 9:45am
Tues 10:00am
Tues 3:00pm

Thurs 2:00pm

where if you click on anyone of these links, it will go to a form where you can schedule an appointment with them. It makes the appointment setting process more seamless.

Questions to consider:
- Why hasn't VR taken off?
- What are some products that haven't changed in the last 30 years.
